uses a technique called style scoping that allows components to define their style without adding any side-effect to the rest of the page. In order to do that, styles are scoped to the component, for instance, if your component is called <code>Header</code>, all your classes will be called <code>Header__&lt;className&gt;___&lt;hash&gt;</code>. To simplify the implementation of this technique, this repository implements the solution proposed by <code>css-modules</code> (check the following article: <a href=http://glenmaddern.com/articles/css-modules>http://glenmaddern.com/articles/css-modules</a>)</p> <h2 id=code-example>Code example</h2> <h4 id=sample-stylus-styelsheet>Sample Stylus styelsheet</h4> <pre><code class=lang-css>.header\\n  background-color: white\\n  color: black\\n  padding: 60px 20px 50px 110px\\n  position: relative\\n\\n  h1\\n    margin: 0\\n    font-size: 44px\\n    font-weight: 600\\n    font-style: italic\\n    a\\n      color: get-white()\\n      &amp;:hover\\n        color: get-white()\\n</code></pre> <h4 id=react-component->React component:</h4> <p>First you need to import your styles</p> <pre><code class=lang-javascript>import styles from &#39;./Header.styl&#39;;\\n</code></pre> <p>That will load a map object with all your style names as keys.
